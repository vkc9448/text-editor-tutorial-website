	  "History of Atom" => "<p>Atom was initially released February 2014 and is constantly being updated with its last stable release being October 29 2017. Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor and is compatible to run on macOs 10.8 or later, Windows 7 or later, Red Hat Linux and Ubuntu Linux. With support for plug-ins written in Node.js, and embedded Git Control, developed by GitHub. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained.</p><p>Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell), a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js. It is written in CoffeeScript and Less. It can also be used as an integrated development environment (IDE). Atom was released from beta, as version 1.0, on June 25, 2015. Its developers call it a 'hackable text editor for the 21st Century'.</p>",

	"Release Note by Developers" => "<p>Today, we are excited to launch the public beta of Atom, a new text editor that's deeply programmable but also easy to use.</p>
																			<p>Sublime and TextMate offer convenience but only limited extensibility. On the other end of the spectrum, Emacs and Vim offer extreme flexibility, but they aren't very approachable and can only be customized with special-purpose scripting languages.</p>
																			<p>We think we can do better. Our goal is a zero-compromise combination of hackability and usability: an editor that will be welcoming to an elementary school student on their first day learning to code, but also a tool they won't outgrow as they develop into seasoned hackers.</p>
																			<p>As we've used Atom to build Atom, what began as an experiment has gradually matured into a tool we can't live without. This is only the beginning, and there's much to do before we achieve our full vision. But we already think we've achieved our basic goal. On the surface, Atom is the modern desktop text editor you've come to expect. Pop the hood, however, and you'll discover a system begging to be hacked on.</p>
																			<p>We'll be rolling out invites over the coming weeks, and we've open-sourced over 80 of the libraries and packages used in the editor. We've been aggressive about exposing the APIs you'll need to write powerful packages, but this also means you should expect some flux as we incorporate your feedback. We'll do our best to make changes as gracefully as possible while still making rapid progress during the beta.</p>
																			<p>We look forward to your feedback, packages, and pull requests. Let's do this!</p>",	

	"What can Atom do?" => "<p>Atom is available able to manage entire projects at a time. </p>
								<p>It can handles all types of files and many different programming languages with the default plugins.</p>

									<li>PHP</li>
									<li>SQL</li>
									<li>And many more!</li>
								</ul>
								<p>And this is just the beginning, Atom is open-sourced so almost everything you can image has some support in Atom. The list is growing everyday.</p>",
		"Layout of Atom" => "<p>Since Atom is able to manage entire project structures. When you open a file you can see all of its contents on the left. <img class='content-image' style='float=right;' src= '" . URL_IMG . "files.png' alt='File system of Atom'/> </p>
							<p>Across the top you can see all the current files you have open by the tab system.</p>
							<p>Simply click on the tab in order to change the current file.</p>
							<p>Themes can be downloaded at <a href='http://atom.io/themes'>https://atom.io/themes</a> and then manually added to the configuration to change the colors and look of the editor.</p>
							<p>Almost everything is configurable. For more information go to our <a href='" . URL . "Documentation/index.php'>documentation page.</a> So go ahead and change it to your personal needs!</p>",
