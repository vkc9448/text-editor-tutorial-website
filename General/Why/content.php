								<p>For real though put content here eventually. Or just leave it and see if Dean really reads all of the content. First person from our group to read this gets a pack of gummies at our next meeting.</p>",
		"Major Differences" => "<p>Main attractions of text editors.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Atom is an IDE. It handles syntax and coding structure much more fluently. Holds the hand of the user. Best for beginners or those who want to clearly see what is going on. Easier time handling multiple files</li>
									<li>Notepad++ is a user supported text editor. It has barely any default built in support, but has a large commuinty. Best for users who edit files one at a time and like to maintain their own file structure.</li>
									<li>Vim is a plain text editor. It has no highlighting or syntax support. Its main draw is the ability to edit rapidly through shortcuts and keystrokes. Hard to learn, satisfying to master.</li>
								</ul>",
		"Is Atom the best for me?" => "<p>If you come from an IDE. Atom is the best for you. Atom will allow for more plugins and custimization, while still maintaining the IDE features.</p>
										<p>If you need to maintain a large amout of files and folder, Atom will be very useful. If you want to be able to immediately get into editing and not spend lots of time learning, Atom is the best for you.")
