Known bugs:
	If you start in mobile view and use the side nav and then change it back to desktop view the side nav will disapear.
		We argue that no one except for developers change from desktop to mobile back to desktop.
	
	HTML validation is not 100% error free.
		We learned in class that validation is more of a guideline to how you should use HTML. The errors generated are not big ones, and since the site
		works in the exact way that we want, we left the errors in validation.
		The problem is with div being a child of the ul tag. We believe that this is not a problem, just the validator complaining.
