		"Getting Started" => "<p>To get started with Atom, we'll need to get it on your system. This section will go over installing Atom on your system as well as the basics of how to build it from source.</p>
													<p>Installing Atom should be fairly simple. Generally, you can go to <a href='https://atom.io'>https://atom.io</a> and at the top of the page you should see a download button as shown here:</p>
													<div class='innertube'>
														<img class='content-image' src= '" . URL_IMG . "windows-downloads.png' alt='Homepage of atom.io'/>
														</div>
													<p>The button or buttons should be specific to your platform and the download package should be easily installable. However, let's go over them here in a bit of detail.</p>",

		"Installing Atom on Windows" => "<p>Atom is available with a Windows installer that can be downloaded from <a href='https://atom.io'>https://atom.io</a> or from Atom Releases named <code>AtomSetup.exe</code>. This setup program will install Atom, add the <code>atom</code> and <code>apm</code> commands to your <code>PATH</code>, and create shortcuts on the desktop and in the start menu.</p>
																		 <div class='innertube'>
																		 	<img class='content-image' src='" . URL_IMG . "windows-system-settings.png' alt='System setting pane of Atom on Windows' />
																		 </div>
																		 <p>The context menu <code>Open with Atom</code> in File Explorer, and the option to make Atom available for file association using <code>Open with...</code>, is controlled by the System Settings panel as seen above.</p>
																		 <p>With Atom open, click on <code>File > Settings</code>, and then the <code>System</code> tab on the left. Check the boxes next to <code>Show in file context menus</code>, as well as <code>Show in folder context menus</code>. And youâ€™re all set.</p>",

		"Portable Mode" => "<p>Atom stores configuration and state in a <code>.atom</code> directory usually located in your home directory (<code>%userprofile%</code> on Windows). You can however run Atom in portable mode where both the app and the configuration are stored together such as on a removable storage device.</p>
												<p>To setup Atom in portable mode download the <a href='https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest'>zip/tpackage for your system</a> and 																extract it to your removable storage.</p>
												<p>Then create a <code>.atom</code> directory alongside the directory that contains atom.exe, for example:</p>
												<div class='code'>e:\atom-1.14\atom.exe<br/>e:\.atom</div>",

		"Portable Notes" => "<ul>
												 <li>The <code>.atom</code> directory must be writeable</li>
												 <li>You can move an existing <code>.atom</code> directory to your portable device</li>
												 <li>Atom can also store its Electron user data in your <code>.atom</code> directory - just create a subdirectory called <code>electronUserData</code> 									 inside <code>.atom</code></li>
												 <li>Alternatively you can set the <code>ATOM_HOME</code> environment variable to point wherever you want (you can write a .sh or .cmd script to 									 temporarily set it and launch it from that)</li>
												 <li>Portable mode installations will not automatically update</li>
												 </ul>",

		"Building Atom from Source" => "<p>If you just want to build Atom from source, you can also do that. The Atom GitHub repository has detailed <a href='https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/docs/build-instructions'>build instructions for Mac, Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD</a>.</p>",

		"Behind a Firewall" => "<p>If you are behind a firewall and seeing SSL errors when installing packages you can disable strict SSL by running:</p>
														<div class='code'>C:\> apm config set strict-ssl false</div>",

		"Using a Proxy?" => "<p>If you are using a HTTP(S) proxy you can configure <code>apm</code> to use it by running:</p>
												 <div class='code'>C:\> apm config set https-proxy <strong>YOUR_PROXY_ADDRESS</strong></div>
												 <p>You can run <code>apm config get https-proxy</code> to verify it has been set correctly.</p>",
